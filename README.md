# GenOrg

GenOrg is a collection of classes designed to form a system that makes real-time generative music using evolutionary algorithms. This quark was created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for my thesis in Music Technology at NYU. Currently, the **main** branch of this repository represents the work that was submitted. There are some issues with it: I would argue that it is rigid and unstable even if it achieves its purpose. The **dev** branch of this repository represents my current work to upgrade this project, making it more configureable and, therefore, hopefully useful. That work, however, relies on the framework established by another quark, [CodexIan](https://github.com/ianmacdougald/CodexIan).
